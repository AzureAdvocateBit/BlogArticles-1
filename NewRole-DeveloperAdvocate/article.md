# Starting a new role at Microsoft

I'm very excited to announce that today is my very first day as a Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft focused on Teams and Graph development! I've really enjoyed working in One Commercial Partner, and learned a tremendous amount from partners and colleagues alike. I wasn't even looking, but when I read the job description ... well it was just too good of a fit.

> _Do you find yourself building Bots? Are you excited about integrating Microsoft Graph data into line of business applications? Are you extending Teams with your custom application? Are you spending time with SharePoint or Azure Active Directory? Find yourself excited about the latest Microsoft Graph schemas? Spend your days letting your mind wander on how you can integrate Microsoft Office Data in your internal Productivity Applications? Use tools like curl and OAuth? Spend your free time pouring over the latest research on collaboration software?_

Yes, yes, yes to all of the above! Me, pick me! And I'm thrilled that they did!

## What is this new job?

The [Cloud Advocates team](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/) is technically in the Azure organization, ultimately reporting to [Scott Guthrie](https://twitter.com/scottgu), which is prety exciting in itself. The goal (as well as I understand it on my very first day!) is to help developers succeed in the Microsoft cloud - all developers, from enterprises to partners to startups to students. Recently, the Cloud Advocates team expanded beyond Azure to also include Power Platform, and now Microsoft 365.

In this new role I expect to be:

* Creating written content, videos, and samples help people learn how to develop collaborative apps using Microsoft 365.
* Speaking at conferences, meetups, coding boot camps, online forums, Twitter, Stack Overflow, Hacker News, and more.
* Collecting and priortizing product feedback and technical blockers with engineering.

So it's not that different than what I was already doing, right? But on a larger scale. And some things I was doing on an extracurricular basis will become part of my day job, which is awesome.

I want to thank 
the US One Commercial Partner Technical Team (OCPTT), especially the Modern Workplace SWARM. It's been a lot of fun and I've learned so much from you all! I look forward to continuing to work with you and Microsoft partners as part of my new role.
