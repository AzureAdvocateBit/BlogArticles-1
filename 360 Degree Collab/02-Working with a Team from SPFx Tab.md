# Working with a Team from an SPFx Tab in Teams

There are a few API's available for Microsoft Teams; among them are the [Teams JavaScript SDK](#) and the [Microsoft Graph API](#). I'm often asked which of these to use in order to interact with the Team where the tab is hosted. For example, a solution might want to post to the Teams channel where it's installed, or to read the members, shared calendar, etc.

This posting will answer that question in the context of the "360 Degree Collaboration" demo (here are the [article](#) and [source code](#)).

A Team provides a "single pane of glass" with a unified user interface to assets across an Office 365 Group.
