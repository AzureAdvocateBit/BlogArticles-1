# The case for tailored collaboration and productivity tools

Over the last 20 years, the [number of administrative assistants](https://newrepublic.com/article/121712/slow-death-secretary) has fallen abruptly, led by an economic recession in 2007 from which most other jobs have since recovered.

Examples of this are abundant in most industries, each of which has its own line of business applications and work flows. One way to address this might be to hire more support people, yet
