<td>Online Forums</td>
<td>Don't mention what product or version you're using; you'll get a wider range of remedies if you leave it open.</td>

<td>Isolating the Problem</td>
<td>Change as many things as possible between each test to try more options in a shorter amount of time.</td>

<td>Searching online</td>
<td>Don't enter the exact wording of the error message or any error numbers on the screen. A more general query will give you more antidotes to try.</td>

<td>4</td>
<td>Making Changes</td>
<td>Try changes at random and don't keep track of what you've changed or undo the changes that didn't help. Some of the changes might help avoid other problems!</td>

<td>Inside help</td>
<td>Everyone who works for a particular vendor is an expert in every product from that vendor. If they won't tell you how to fix the problem, they're deliberately holding out on you!</td>

<td>6</td>
<td>Getting Support</td>
<td>Put a lot of pressure on anyone helping you, and ask for status updates as frequently as possible. Most people work best under pressure.</td>
</tr><tr>

<td>Testing a fix</td>
<td>If a possible fix doesn't work, try it again and again; computers are quirky and sometimes you just have to hit them at the right moment.</td>

<td>Intermittent problems</td>
<td>If the problem only happens occasionally, just forget about it! It probably won't affect users in production.</td>
</tr><tr>

<td>Event Logs</td>
<td>Select a computer and log file at random and don't bother to try and figure out what server or service failed. All log files are the same!</td>

<td>Articles written on April 1</td>
<td>Perhaps you noticed the date at the top of this article: it's April Fools day! And you'd be a fool to follow any of the previous advice! In fact, these are all behaviors I've noticed that make it more difficult to succeed, so please reverse each item above.</td>
