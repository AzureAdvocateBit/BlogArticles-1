IDEA for an article: tongue in cheek guide to troubleshooting and getting support
(This is a DRAFT and I'm planning on using this idea on 4/1/2019. I work on my articles in the open so you can see this now, but don't steal my idea! :-) )

Here are the top 10 tips:

1. Don't specify what product or version you're using; you'll get a wider range of answers if you leave it open

1. When troubleshooting, change as many things as possible between each test; it will let you try more things in a shorter amount of time

1. When searching for a fix, don't enter the exact wording of the error message, or any error numbers provided on the screen. A more general query will give you more possible fixes to look at.

1. When troubleshooting, try things at random and don't keep track of what you've changed or undo the changes that didn't fix the problem. Some of the changes might help avoid other problems!

1. Everyone who works for a particular vendor is an expert in every product from that vendor. If they won't tell you how to fix the problem, they're deliberately holding out on you! Hold their feet to the fire and eventually they'll give in and tell you the fix.

1. Be sure to put as much pressure as possible on the person responsible for fixing a problem, and ask for status updates as frequently as possible. Most people work best under pressure, and your status requests won't distract them from trying to help you.

1. If a possible fix doesn't work, try it again and again; computers are quirky and sometimes you just have to hit them at the right moment.

1. If you notice an intermittent problem during testing, go ahead and ship it, it probably won't affect users in production.

1. When viewing log files, select a server and file at random and don't bother to try and figure out what server was running the failed request. All log files are the same!

(LAST): It's April Fools day ... and you'd be a fool to take the advice in this article. Instead, do the opposite.
