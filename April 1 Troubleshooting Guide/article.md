# Top 10 Troubleshooting Tips for Computer Professionals

Murphy's famous law is understated when it comes to computers. All of us in technical roles have experienced the agony and frustration that comes when things don't go well and we have to troubleshoot the system. This article contains my top ten tips for effective troubleshooting that I've noticed others using over the years; I hope they're helpful!

1. When posting in an online forum, don't specify what product or version you're using; you'll get a wider range of answers if you leave it open. For example, SharePoint 2010, SharePoint 2016, and SharePoint Online are all the same, so just ask for advice on "SharePoint."
1. When troubleshooting, change as many things as possible between each test; you'll be able to try more possible solutions in a shorter amount of time.
1. When searching for a fix or posting in an online forum, don't enter the exact wording of the error message, or any error numbers provided on the screen. A more general query will give you more possible fixes to look at.
1. When troubleshooting, try things at random and don't keep track of what you've changed or undo the changes that didn't fix the problem. Some of the changes might help avoid other problems!
1. Everyone who works for a particular vendor is an expert in every product from that vendor. If they won't tell you how to fix the problem, they're deliberately holding out on you! If you're persistent and forceful enough, eventually they'll give in and tell you the solution.
1. Be sure to put a lot of pressure on anyone helping you fix a problem, and ask for status updates as frequently as possible. Most people work best under pressure, and your requests will ensure they understand how important it is and won't distract them from trying to help you.
1. If a possible fix doesn't work, try it again and again; computers are quirky and sometimes you just have to hit them at the right moment.
1. If you notice an intermittent problem during testing, just forget about it! It probably won't affect users in production.
1. When viewing log files or an event viewer, select a computer and log file at random and don't bother to try and figure out what server or service failed. All log files are the same!
1. Perhaps you noticed the date at the top of this article: it's April Fools day! And you'd be a fool to follow any of the previous advice! In fact, these are all behaviors I've noticed that make it more difficult to succeed, so please reverse each item above.

I hope this has been helpful and that whatever problems technology throws at you, you find the cause and a solution that will work over time. And as always, thanks for reading!
